    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this chapter, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain how using loops help you to write DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) code in Python.\n",
    "Describe the syntax for two basic looping structures used in Python: while and for.\n",
    "Remove repetition in code by using loops to automate data tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Need To Follow Along In This Chapter?\n",
    "\n",
    "You should have Python Conda environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure that you have completed the chapters on Jupyter Notebook, Numpy Arrays, and Pandas Dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Loops?\n",
    "\n",
    "A loop is a sequence of operations that are performed over and over in some specified order. Loops can help you to eliminate repetition in code by replacing duplicate lines of code with an iteration, meaning that you can iteratively execute the same code line or block until it reaches a specified end point."

    "## While Loops \n",
    "\n",
    "A while loop is used to iteratively execute code until a pre-defined condition is no longer satisfied (i.e. results in a value of False).\n",
    "\n",
    "That condition could be a limit on how many times you want the code to run, or that results of the code reach a certain value (e.g. code will iteratively execute as long as the current value of the results is less than 5).\n",
    "\n",
    "After the pre-defined condition is no longer True, the loop will not execute another iteration."
